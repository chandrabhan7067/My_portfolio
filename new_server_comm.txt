Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

// The Path module provides a way of working with directories and file paths
// Node. js path module is used for handling and transforming file paths

// Common use for the File System module:
// Read files
// Create files
// Update files
// Delete files
// Rename files


// we have a one other option to join the file which is resolve The method creates absoulte path from right to left until an absolute path is constructed.

// The two functions deal with segments starting with / in very different ways; join will just concatenate it with the previous argument, however resolve will treat this as the root directory, and ignore all previous paths - think of it as the result of executing cd with each argument:

// app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

// You can use __dirname to check on which directories your files live.
